 A peak element in an array is the one that is not smaller than its neighbours.
Given an array arr[] of size N, find the index of any one of its peak elements.
Note: The generated output will always be 1 if the index that you return is correct. Otherwise output will be 0.

Input:
N = 3
arr[] = {1,2,3}
Output: 1
Explanation: index 2 is 3.
It is the peak element as it is 
greater than its neighbour 2.

Expected Time Complexity: O(log N)
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(1)
